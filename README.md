<h1>CLang</h1>

The CLang is an interpreter-based implementation of C written in TypeScript. 

It supports the following features of C:
- Primitives: (unsigned) char, short, int, float, double, long
- Derived types: strings and arrays (both statically/dynamically allocated)
- Function declaration/application, Variable declaration/initialization/assignment
- Operators: arithmetic (`<`. `<=`. `==`, `+`, `-`, etc.), logical (`&&`, `||`), variable address (`&`), assignment(`=`, `+=`, `/=`, etc.) `sizeof`, pointers
- Loops: `while`, `for`, `do while`
- Conditionals: `if else`, `switch case` statements
- Memory management: pointers, pointers-to-pointers, dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`
